ClickMorph (previously ClickMog) expands the usability of [LucidMorph](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-bots-programs/657637-lucid-morph-basic-morphing-tool.html) allowing the user to "ClickMorph" like existed in tMorph. You can morph by alt-clicking on a model.

If the game crashes it's most likely due to the LucidMorph in-game commands being unstable. Please report any Lua errors or bugs in [Issues](https://github.com/Ketho/ClickMorph/issues) or #lm-help-desk.
