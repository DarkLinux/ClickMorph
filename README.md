ClickMorph lets you alt-click to morph with [iMorph](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/wow-classic/wow-classic-general/799754-wow-classic-morpher.html), [jMorph](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-bots-programs/795619-jmorph-tmorph-morpher-recreated.html) or [LucidMorph](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-bots-programs/657637-lucid-morph-basic-morphing-tool.html)  
It's _not_ standalone, you still need to inject the morpher's DLL first
